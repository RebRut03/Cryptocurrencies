# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

In this portion of the cryptocurrency project, I am creating an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers, and they have asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

I have decided to use unsupervised learning because the data I am working with is not ideal, and it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models since there is no known output. To group the cryptocurrencies, I will use a clustering algorithm and data visualizations to share the findings.
